* Parameter choices
NX, NZ = number of points
LX, LZ = non-dimensional lengths

Smyth, Moum & Caldwell have dimensional values

h* = 1m - 25m = width of shear layer
u* = 0.5 - 2m/s = Δu across shear layer
t = h*/u*
B* = N² × h* = 1e-3 × 10 = 1e-3 ≡ 1 kg/m³ density jump across

sampling properties:
Z = 1-2m; U = 0.2-0.5m/s (this should be related to ΔU); T = 5-25s

CTD Δz = 10-20m

* Next steps
1. Need to compare inferred Jq against ΔBPE in /volume sampled by χpod/
   - I should be able to integrate the ~means.b~ field between z-limits of trajectory to get BPE and look at time-evolution of that?
   - but I don't think I can sort that :( .

2. Do non-dimensionalization more carefully
   - Could remove re-dimensionalization from ~sample_along_trajectory~
   - Fix non-dimensionalization of ε, χ in ~process_sampled_field.~
